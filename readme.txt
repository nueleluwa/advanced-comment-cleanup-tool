Automatically delete spam, pending, approved, or trash comments in configurable batches with advanced scheduling, analytics, and REST API support.

== Description ==

**Advanced Comment Cleanup Tool** is a modern, production-ready WordPress plugin that helps you maintain a clean comments database by automatically deleting unwanted comments in batches.

= Key Features =

* **Automatic Deletion** - Schedule batch deletions every 1-60 minutes
* **Flexible Selection** - Choose which comment types to delete (spam, pending, approved, trash)
* **Age Filtering** - Delete only comments older than specified days
* **Batch Processing** - Process 1-50 comments per run to prevent server overload
* **Real-Time Statistics** - Live comment counts with auto-refresh
* **Advanced Analytics** - 30-day tracking with interactive charts
* **Activity Logging** - Track last 100 deletion activities
* **Manual Controls** - Delete batch immediately with one click
* **REST API** - Full API access for headless WordPress setups
* **Professional Interface** - Clean, WordPress-native admin design
* **Security Hardened** - WordPress VIP coding standards compliant

= Perfect For =

* **High-Traffic Sites** - Automatically manage spam comments
* **Blogs & News Sites** - Keep comment sections clean
* **E-commerce Stores** - Remove spam from product reviews
* **Membership Sites** - Maintain clean discussion areas
* **Database Optimization** - Regular cleanup for better performance

= How It Works =

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Go to Settings → Auto Delete Comments
3. Configure your preferences (batch size, interval, comment types)
4. Enable automatic deletion
5. Monitor activity through the dashboard

Comments are permanently deleted using WordPress's native `wp_delete_comment()` function, ensuring all associated metadata is properly cleaned up.

= Security & Performance =

* **Security Rating:** A+ (WordPress VIP Standards)
* **Nonce verification** on all AJAX requests
* **Capability checks** for all admin operations
* **Input sanitization** using WordPress functions
* **Output escaping** throughout
* **Optimized queries** using `fields => 'ids'`
* **Batch processing** prevents timeouts and server overload
* **Limited batch size** (max 50) prevents URI errors

= REST API Endpoints =

The plugin provides REST API endpoints for headless WordPress setups:

* `GET /wp-json/advanced-comment-cleanup/v1/stats` - Get current comment statistics
* `GET /wp-json/advanced-comment-cleanup/v1/analytics` - Get deletion analytics

All endpoints require `manage_options` capability for security.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it safe to delete approved comments? =

Deleting approved comments is risky as these are legitimate user contributions. Only enable this if you're certain you want to remove them. Always test with a small batch first.

= Can I recover deleted comments? =

No. Comments are permanently deleted using WordPress's native deletion function. They cannot be recovered. Always backup your database before enabling automatic deletion of approved comments.

= How does the batch size affect performance? =

Smaller batch sizes (10-20) are safer and have minimal impact on server resources. Larger batches (30-50) process more comments faster but may use more resources. The plugin limits batch size to 50 to prevent server errors.

= What happens if I disable the plugin? =

When you disable the plugin, all scheduled cron jobs are automatically removed. Your existing comments remain unchanged. Settings are preserved and will be restored if you reactivate the plugin.

= Does this work with custom comment types? =

The plugin works with WordPress's native comment statuses: spam, pending (hold), approved, and trash. It uses WordPress's standard comment system and should work with most comment-related plugins.

= How often should I run the deletion? =

For most sites, running every 5-10 minutes with a batch size of 15-20 is ideal. High-traffic sites with lots of spam may benefit from more frequent runs (3-5 minutes). Low-traffic sites can use longer intervals (10-30 minutes).

= Does this affect site performance? =

No. The plugin uses WordPress cron for background processing and optimized queries. Deletion runs asynchronously and has minimal impact on site performance.

= Can I use this with WP-CLI? =

Yes! You can trigger manual deletion using WordPress's cron system:
`wp cron event run adc_delete_comments_batch`

= Is this compatible with multisite? =

Yes, the plugin is compatible with WordPress multisite. Each site in the network has its own independent configuration.

= Does this delete comment metadata? =

Yes. The plugin uses WordPress's native `wp_delete_comment()` function with the force delete parameter, which removes all associated metadata properly.
